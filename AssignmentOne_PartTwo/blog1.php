            <p class="first">We as humans have always known that we live just to die. But of course our purpose isn't to
                die, if that was the case then all of nature's lives would have been the most useless creation. All life
                have a reason to live, for better of for worse. Humans in particular have reason to live, other than to
                reproduce and continue the cycle of life </p>
            <p>"But what might the reason be?" you might ask. In fact, that seems to be the question most human face.
                "Why am I here?" "Why was I born?" "Why do I exist?" And for those questions, life itself answers the
                question. For some it might seem obvious, for some it might be a foggy answer. Some die without even
                geting the answer... some without even questioning it. </p>
            <p>I've asked myself that before, "Why do I live?" Do I know the answer... I don't think I do. But until I
                do, I will be going with the flow and see where life will lead me. Living with the flow... perhaps
                that's what life is for all of us... We live with whatever is happening and adapt. Life shapes us to be
                who we are and that gives us a sense of character and personality. But what does this all mean? Do we
                get out purpose from who we are? Does the world shape our reason?</p>
