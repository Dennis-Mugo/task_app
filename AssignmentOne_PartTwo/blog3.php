            <hr>
            <p class="first">What would life be like if all of us were the same people. Same face, same voice, same
                sent, same interests, same opinions, same names, same feelings, <i>same life</i></p>
            <p>If all were one, what would become of us. Would we desperately look for a hint of difference, or will we
                be so used to the concept of same being that the idea of diversity would be a paradox to us.</p>
            <p>What would it be life to love someone else? Would it be like falling in love with oneself? Will we even
                be capable to love? Is it even possible to live life knowing that everyone has already lived that life
                and knowing how the life will be since its been lived many times before</p>
            <p>In all honesty the idea of all being one is such a puzzle. How can life be the exact same thing again and
                again all across time? Whatever it would be like, I know it is an experience no being will ever
                experience. It is what I would like to call an impossible life.</p>
